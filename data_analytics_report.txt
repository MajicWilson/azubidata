### Data Analytics Pathway Assessment: Summary Report

#### Objective:
Predict client subscription to term deposits using operational data.

#### Key Findings:
1. Dataset is highly imbalanced (88.73% "No", 11.27% "Yes").
2. Features like `duration` and `poutcome` significantly impact predictions.

#### Approach:
1. Conducted EDA, removed redundant features, and handled class imbalance.
2. Preprocessed data with scaling and one-hot encoding.
3. Built and evaluated a Random Forest model.

#### Results (After Threshold Adjustment):
- Precision (Class 1): 56%
- Recall (Class 1): 77%
- F1 Score (Class 1): 65%
- ROC-AUC: 0.85

#### Recommendations:
1. Prioritize clients with high call durations and positive campaign outcomes.
2. Improve campaign targeting to enhance subscription rates.
