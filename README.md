# Data Analytics Pathway Assessment

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on features such as demographics, campaign interactions, and economic indicators. The solution involves:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Machine Learning Modeling
- Evaluation and Reporting

## Files in the Repository
- **data_analytics_code.py**: Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **data_analytics_report.txt**: Summary report with key findings, insights, and recommendations.
- **bank-additional-full.csv**: Dataset used for training and testing the model (place this in the same directory as the script).
